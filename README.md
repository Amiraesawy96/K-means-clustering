# K-means-clustering
Using the data provided in the file “Data.txt” with K = 3, apply K-means algorithm. Each row in the file corresponds to one data point.
One important aspect of K-means that changes the results significantly is the initialization. So you should run the K-means algorithm with the given initialization below above 100 times. The final output of the K-means clustering is the result that gives the minimum average distance between the points and the centers of their corresponding clusters.
One possible startegy for intialization cluster centers is to select the furthest points from each other.
